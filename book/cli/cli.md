# CLI Reference

Ream can be operated via the CLI by running either the `ream lean_node` or `ream beacon_node` command. To stop it, press `ctrl-c`. You may need to wait a bit as Ream tears down existing p2p connections or other cleanup tasks.

However, Ream has more commands:

{{#include ./SUMMARY.md}}
