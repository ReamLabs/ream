## What is Ream

Ream aims to be modular, contributor-friendly, and blazingly fast implementation of the Beam Chain specification.

One of our goals is to build an ecosystem where developers can seamlessly build on Ream, saving time and avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel.

## What is the Beam Chain

The Beam Chain is the next generation of Ethereum Consensus, incorporating all of the greatest and latest ideas from the Ethereum research roadmap. Its goal is to transition quickly and safely from the Beacon Chain to a consensus layer design much closer to the final design of Ethereum.
